# Mobile Booth - Created by team 15

A fun way to create memories and share them.

## üî• Project Description
* Problem: Remember when you and your friends never left the mall without a stop at the photo booth? It was a tradition‚Äîcapturing memories in a strip of snapshots. But as smartphones took over, that ritual faded. The instant convenience of phone cameras replaced the charm of printed photo strips, making those nostalgic moments a thing of the past.
* Solution: Our app is bringing that tradition back‚Äîusing the very technology that replaced photo booths to revive them!

* Key Features:
  - Filters and Edits: Use filters on your photos and edit them. In a future update, potentially leverage ML to allow the user to configure a custom background in all or some of their photos.
  - Sharing: Download photo, store in you own personal cloud, or share with friends and family.
  - Video: User can opt to have short videos taken instead of photos.
  - Authentication: User authenticates using Google for human verification and photo access.
  - Configuration: User has control over # of photos are taken, filters used, and the photo booth template

* Why this project? Currently, building a photo album to commemorate a moment requires a physical photo booth, or you have to do it manually. MobileBooth users can conveniently do all of the steps in a single place. The convenience of our system also will help people that are photo-shy, by making the process more fun and less awkward.
