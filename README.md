# Mobile Booth - Created by team 15

A fun way to create memories and share them.

## üî• Project Description
* Problem: Photo booths used to be a staple in malls and public areas before the iPhone, but are now rarely used. 
* Solution: Our app is revitalizing this tradition, using the technology that killed the photo booth to save the photo booth!

* Key Features:
  - Custom background: Leverage ML to allow the user to configure a custom background in all or some of their photos
  - Sharing: Download photo, store in the cloud, or share with friends and family.
  - Video: User can opt to have short videos taken instead of photos.
  - Authentication: User authenticates using Google for human verification and photo access.
  - Configuration: User has control over # of photos are taken, filters used, and the photo booth template

  
* Why this project? Currently, building a photo album to commemorate a moment requires a physical photo booth, or you have to do it manually. MobileBooth users can conveniently do all of the steps in a single place.
